# IFC Node Editor

IFC Node Editor is an application based on [Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut) and its dependencies.

This software aims to create a node-based way to edit the [Industry Foundation Classes](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/) files. It is still in very early stages. 

And I can't guarantee that this repo won't become in-house use.
